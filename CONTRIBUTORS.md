### üîê Deployment & Access Notice

This repository was originally developed as a collaborative project. While all listed contributors are acknowledged for their roles in development, **deployment and backend access (including paid services such as Railway or hosting credentials) are managed individually**.

Each contributor is responsible for their own deployment and environment configuration. **No contributor has access to another's paid accounts or deployment infrastructure unless explicitly granted**.
